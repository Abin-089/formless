From early recordings and\ncassettes to digital media and MP3s, a song has always lived as a static piece of\ninformation interpreted by a machine to transfer an experience between humans. The\nproblem with this trend is that the machine vendor has always established the terms\nof access to the song. Along every step in the progression, this model has crushed\ncreators&mdash;eliminating any control over pricing, and the ability to directly connect\nwith consumers. In this paper we propose a technology advancement that disrupts\nthis trend by redefining digital content (such as music), not as static information, but\nas a dynamic self-contained machine. A simple analogy is the vending machine. A\nvending machine can be placed anywhere in the world, and its owner controls its\naccess independent of the property on which it operates.\nSHARE is a protocol that enables creators to make orders of magnitude more\nmoney for their digital content by eliminating the dependence on centralized content\nstreaming machines (e.g. Apple, Spotify, and YouTube) altogether. Instead, each\npiece of content encapsulates its own implementation of its access policy,\nindependent of the application used to experience it. This \"smart-content\" itself is the\nmachine. By expanding the definition of digital content (embodied by creator controlled smart contracts) beyond a static piece of information, and reimagining\ndistribution using peer-to-peer, pay-for-access micro-transactions on blockchain, any\nstreaming platform can instantly authenticate for access to a piece of digital content,\nexecute an instant micropayment based on creator specified terms, and stream the\nexperience to consumers. Most importantly, the price of the micropayment is set by\nthe creator, not the platform. SHARE inverts the access model."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":""},{"href":"https://formless-eng.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/share+whitepaper+7.pdf","type":"link","children":[{"text":"Read the full whitepaper"}]},{"text":""}]}],"shortContent":"The SHARE Protocol","authorId":"clvv3eynu0001ses2n6awixc3","createdAt":"16 Feb 2022","category":{"id":"clwjdklhh0002zlf3ie2d3p08","title":"Whitepaper"},"readMinutes":2,"image":"https://formless-cms.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/e589df15-9506-4109-b3d1-abb259b29981.png"}],"featuredPost":{"id":"cm20s749c0001s7s75g4mnymr","title":"Community Splits Drives a 500% Increase in Engagement","slug":"recap-communitysplits-engagement","image_id":"6beffa0a-2150-4d83-ad09-77a7ffbb44ef","image_filesize":53913,"image_width":1240,"image_height":657,"image_extension":"png","categoryId":"clvvghrdf0005qaeamb1vca2c","content":[{"type":"heading","level":2,"children":[{"text":"Overview"}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"SHARE Technology is transforming social engagement by allowing creators to share earnings on both digital and physical products with their fans and collaborators, which boosts awareness and builds stronger community connections.
