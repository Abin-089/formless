(&ldquo;Formless,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;). These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your access to and use of the Share website(s), our APIs, mobile app (the &ldquo;App&rdquo;), and any other software, tools, features, or functionalities provided on or in connection with our services; including without limitation using our services to create, view, and explore smart contracts and use our tools, at your own discretion, to connect directly with others to purchase, and sell access to content distributed using smart contracts on public blockchains (collectively, the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;). &ldquo;Smart contract&rdquo; in these Terms means a pay-for-access (PFA) smart contract. PFA smart contracts enable the price per access (e.g. view or listen) to be set to a nonzero value. We call the default implementation of the PFA interface that conforms to the SHARE protocol a &rdquo;Green NFT (G-NFT)&rdquo;. G-NFTs are non-fungible tokens with living, creator-controlled content. G-NFT content is conceptually living and revenue streams flow to creators on each access for the lifetime of the art, independent of a sale of the contract itself.</li><li>For purposes of these Terms, &ldquo;user&rdquo;, &ldquo;you&rdquo;, and &ldquo;your&rdquo; means you as the user of the Service. If you use the Service on behalf of a company or other entity then &ldquo;you&rdquo; includes you and that entity, and you represent and warrant that (a) you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to these Terms, and (b) you agree to these Terms on the entity&rsquo;s behalf.<br><br>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. AS OUTLINED IN SECTION 16 BELOW, THEY INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER WHICH (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS) REQUIRE ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN BY A JUDGE OR JURY IN COURT.<br><br>BY CLICKING TO ACCEPT AND/OR USING OUR SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL OF THE TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.<br><br>Formless is not a wallet provider, exchange, broker, financial institution, or creditor. Formless provides a peer-to-peer blockchain technology-based service that helps users discover and directly interact with each other and G-NFTs available on public blockchains. We do not have custody or control over the smart contracts or blockchains you are interacting with. To use our Service, you may use a third-party wallet that allows you to engage in transactions on blockchains. Alternatively, you may use services such as Apple Pay and Google Pay to engage in transactions for access to content distributed using G-NFTs. No G-NFT transactions using the Service transfer ownership of the digital content of the G-NFT between the seller and the purchaser, therefore no purchase grants ownership rights to the digital content.<br><br>Formless is not a party to any agreement between any users. You bear full responsibility for verifying the identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of G-NFTs that you purchase access to from third-party content creators using the Service and we make no claims about the identity, legitimacy, functionality, or authenticity of users or G-NFTs (and any content associated with the G-NFTs) visible on the Service.<br><br>Because we have a growing number of services, we sometimes need to provide additional terms for specific services (and such services are deemed part of the &ldquo;Service&rdquo; hereunder and shall also be subject to these Terms). Those additional terms and conditions, which are available with the relevant service, then become part of your agreement with us if you use those services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and any additional applicable terms we may provide for a specific service, such additional terms shall control for that specific service.<br><br>Formless reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and at our sole discretion. If we make material changes to these Terms, we will use reasonable efforts to provide notice of such changes, such as by providing notice through the Service or updating the &ldquo;Last Updated&rdquo; date at the beginning of these Terms. By continuing to access or use the Service, you confirm your acceptance of the revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference effective as of the date these Terms are updated. It is your sole responsibility to review the Terms from time to time to view such changes and to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Service.</li><li>Accessing the Service<br>Your blockchain address functions as your identity on Share. Accordingly, you will need a blockchain address and a third-party wallet to distribute content using the Service. By using your wallet in connection with the Service, you agree that you are using that wallet under the terms and conditions of the applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with Formless, and Formless does not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. Formless accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and makes no representations or warranties regarding how the Service will operate with any specific wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping your wallet secure and you should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue related to your wallet, please contact your wallet provider.<br><br>You also represent and warrant that you will comply with all applicable laws (e.g., local, state, federal, and other laws) when using the Service. Without limiting the foregoing, by using the Service, you represent and warrant that: (a) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo; and (b) you have not been identified as a Specially Designated National or placed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited, sanctioned, or restricted parties. If you access or use the Service outside the United States, you are solely responsible for ensuring that your access and use of the Service in such country, territory, or jurisdiction does not violate any applicable laws.<br><br>Formless may require you to provide additional information and documents in certain circumstances, such as at the request of any government authority, as any applicable law or regulation dictates, or to investigate a potential violation of these Terms. In such cases, Formless, in its sole discretion, may block your ability to access the Service until such additional information and documents are processed by Formless. If you do not provide complete and accurate information in response to such a request, Formless may refuse to restore your access to the Service.<br><br>Your access and use of the Service may be interrupted from time to time for any of several reasons, including, without limitation, the malfunction of equipment, periodic updating, maintenance, or repair of the Service, or other actions that Formless, in its sole discretion, may elect to take.<br><br>We require all users to be at least 18 years old. If you are at least 13 years old but under 18 years old, you may only use Formless through a parent or guardian and with their approval and oversight. That account holder is responsible for your actions using the Service. It is prohibited to use our Service if you are under 13 years old.</li><li>Ownership<br>The Service, including its &ldquo;look and feel&rdquo; (e.g., text, graphics, images, logos, page headers, button icons, and scripts), proprietary content, information and other materials, and all content and other materials contained therein, including, without limitation, the Share logo and all designs, text, graphics, pictures, data, software, sound files, other files, and the selection and arrangement thereof are the proprietary property of Formless or our affiliates, licensors, or users, as applicable, and you agree not to take any action(s) inconsistent with such ownership interests.

Formless does not provide dispute resolution services for such disagreements and the parties must resolve those disputes directly.</li><li>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute, controversy, or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Service, to any products sold or distributed through the Service, or to any aspect of your relationship with Formless, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, including threshold questions of the arbitrability of such dispute, controversy, or claim except that (1) you or Formless may assert claims in small claims court, but only if the claims qualify, the claims remain only in such court, and the claims remain on an individual, non-representative, and non-class basis; and (2) you or Formless may seek injunctive or equitable relief in a court of proper jurisdiction if the claim relates to intellectual property infringement or other misuses of intellectual property rights.</li><li>Dispute resolution process. You and Formless both agree to engage in good-faith efforts to resolve disputes prior to either party initiating an arbitration, small claims court proceeding, or equitable relief for intellectual property infringement. You must initiate this dispute resolution process by sending a letter describing the nature of your claim and desired resolution to<!-- --> <a href="mailto:info@formless.xyz">info@formless.xyz</a>. Formless Both parties agree to meet and confer personally, by telephone, or by videoconference (hereinafter &ldquo;Conference&rdquo;) to discuss the dispute and attempt in good faith to reach a mutually beneficial outcome that avoids the expenses of arbitration or, where applicable, litigation. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the Conference. Likewise, if Formless is represented by counsel, its counsel may participate in the Conference as well, but Formless agrees to have a company representative fully participate in the Conference. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process and Conference required by this paragraph. If the parties do not reach an agreement to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after initiation of this dispute resolution process, either party may commence arbitration, file an action in small claims court, or file a claim for injunctive or equitable relief in a court of proper jurisdiction for matters relating to intellectual property infringement, if the claims qualify.</li><li>Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding after participating in the dispute resolution process, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to<!-- --> <a href="mailto:info@formless.xyz">info@formless.xyz</a>. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys&rsquo; fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS&rsquo;s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS&rsquo;s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the JAMS Consumer Minimum Standards then in effect. JAMS&rsquo;s rules are available at jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352- 5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Formless will pay them for you if you complied with the dispute resolution process set forth above. In addition, Formless will reimburse all such JAMS filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous or you did not comply with the dispute resolution process set forth above, except that if you have initiated the arbitration claim, you will still be required to pay the lesser of $250 or the maximum amount permitted under the JAMS Rules for arbitration claims initiated by you. You are still responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including without limitation, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or videoconference, based on written submissions, in person in your hometown area (if you live in the United States), or at another mutually agreed upon location that is reasonably convenient to you. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li><li>Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Formless. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum&rsquo;s rules, and these Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.</li><li>Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND FORMLESS HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and FORMLESS are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the second bullet of this Section 16, above (&ldquo;Applicability of Arbitration Agreement&rdquo;). An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</li><li>Waiver of Class Actions and Class Arbitrations. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A REPRESENTATIVE OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY. Accordingly, under the arbitration procedures outlined in this section, an arbitrator shall not combine or consolidate more than one party&rsquo;s claims without the written consent of all affected parties to an arbitration proceeding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you and Formless agree that no dispute shall proceed by way of class arbitration without the written consent of all affected parties. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any part of this subsection&rsquo;s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in New York County in the State of New York. All other claims shall be arbitrated.</li><li>Severability. Except as provided in this Section, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</li><li>Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Formless.</li><li>Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if Formless makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing to Formless at info@formless.xyz.</li></ul></li><li>Governing Law and Venue<br>These Terms and your access to and use of the Service shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict of law rules or principles of the State of New York, or any other jurisdiction that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction). Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration as set forth in Section 16 or cannot be heard in small claims court, shall be resolved in the state or federal courts in the State of Delaware, and the United States, respectively, sitting in the State of Delaware.</li><li>Termination<br>If you breach any of the provisions of these Terms, all licenses granted by Formless will terminate automatically. Additionally, notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right, with or without notice and in our sole discretion, to suspend, disable, terminate, or delete your Account and/or your ability to access or use the Service (or any part of the foregoing) at any time and for any or no reason, and you acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation to you in such event and that you will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts that you have already paid to us.</li><li>Severability<br>If any term, clause, or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause, or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause, or provision, or any other term, clause, or provision of these Terms.</li><li>Injunctive Relief<br>You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to Formless for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and Formless shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without a bond, other security, or proof of damages.</li><li>California Residents<br>If you are a California resident, in accordance with Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1789.3, you may report complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112 Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</li><li>Export Laws<br>You agree that you will not export or re-export, directly or indirectly, the Service, and/or other information or materials provided by Formless hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export without first obtaining such license or approval. In particular, but without limitation, the Service may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries or any country that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a &ldquo;terrorist supporting&rdquo; country, or (b) to anyone listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person&rsquo;s List or Entity List. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You are responsible for and hereby agree to comply at your sole expense with all applicable United States export laws and regulations.</li><li>Survival<br>All sections which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and notwithstanding any termination of these Terms by Formless or you. Termination will not limit any of Formless&rsquo;s other rights or remedies at law or in equity.</li><li>Miscellaneous<br>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Formless relating to your access to and use of the Service. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of Formless, and Formless&rsquo;s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein are for reference only and shall not be read to have any legal effect.<br><br>The Service is operated by us in the United States. Those who choose to access the Service from locations outside the United States do so at their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You and Formless agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms.<br><br>Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.</li></ol></article></div></div><div class="relative w-full"><div class="absolute left-0 top-0 z-[-1] w-screen h-full"><div id="footer" class="s-full"></div><div class="s-full absolute left-0
